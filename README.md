# FastAPI BaseModel

This repository demonstrates how to use **Pydantic's BaseModel** with **FastAPI** to build a REST API. The API is lightweight, fast, and leverages automatic validation and serialization through Pydantic models.

## ðŸ“„ File Descriptions

- `main.py` â€“ FastAPI app that loads patient data and serves it through a REST endpoint using `BaseModel`.
- `patients.json` â€“ Sample dataset of patient records including BMI and health verdicts.

## ðŸš€ Running the App

```
pip install fastapi pydantic uvicorn
```

Then start the API:
